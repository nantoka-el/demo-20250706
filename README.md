# demo-20250706

This repository contains a simple React application deployed to GitHub Pages.

The app is located in the [`karaoke-app`](./karaoke-app) directory. Pushing to
the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and
deploys the contents of `dist` to the `gh-pages` branch.

Once the workflow has run, the site is available at
<https://nantoka-el.github.io/demo-20250706/>.
